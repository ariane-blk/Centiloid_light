## Why Standardize Amyloid PET Quantification?

The Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) is the most common measure of amyloid load.

</div>

However, SUVR are difficult to interpret, and different tracers (e.g., PiB, Florbetapir, Florbetaben, Flutemetamol, [F-18]NAV4694) and processing pipelines produce different scales. 
SUVR values are dependant on:
- Tracer
- Acquisition time window
- Scanner resolution
- Processing pipeline (e.g. registration software)
- Tartet and Reference region

</div>

As a result, SUVR variability makes it difficult to:
- Compare amyloid load across tracers
- Compare results across studies and centres
- Pool data from different cohorts
- Define universally accepted cut-offs (e.g. for amyloid positivity)

To address this, the **Centiloid scale (CL)** was proposed by Klunk et al. (2015), with the idea to define a **standardized metric** across tracers and pipeline. The scale has two *anchor* points:

- **0 CL**: Mean amyloid burden in young healthy controls  
- **100 CL**: Mean amyloid burden in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease patients

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

Once mapped to this scale, SUVR values from *any* validated tracer and pipeline can be **converted to Centiloids**, enabling consistent interpretation and comparison in various contexts (see Interpretation tab).

## Key Features of the Centiloid Scale

- ðŸ“ˆ Linear transformation of SUVR  
- ðŸ“Š Allows comparison of amyloid loads from multiple tracers and processing methods  
- ðŸ”§ Requires pipeline validation if using custom methods  
- ðŸ”— Supported by an open-access reference data available via [GAAIN](https://www.gaain.org/centiloid-project)

## Workshop overview:

This app was designed to provide an overview of the Centiloid scale with interactive examples.
The following topics are covered:
- How the Centiloid is defined and calculated  
- How to interpret it
- How to validate your own processing pipeline  
- Provide a database of software with Centiloid

Letâ€™s get started :)
